# FaceMaskDetection
We applied transfer learning on the following models:
1) MobileNetV2
2) InceptionV3
3) VGG-16<br/>
All the above networks are pre-trained on imagenet dataset and the transfer learning models are trained on the dataset: <a>https://github.com/PranavBharadwaj-1328/FaceMask_Datasets</a><br/>
The models performed as follows:<br/>
